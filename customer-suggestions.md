_Matthew_ 
> I'd really like to have the ability to use the smart bulbs as an alarm - to wake me in the morning. I'd want the option to use flashing colors or a gradually increasing white light. I think I saw that the alarm is planned and coming in an update - was wondering if that's the case, and maybe when we could use it! (I'm very excited)

_Everton_ 
> I would say auto wake up alarm light, anyway, The idea of LIFX bulb it is already a brilliant idea. Love it and I can't wait to get my hands on it.

_Gustavo_
> At a certain time (scheduled) the lights could dim-up so that you can start waiking up
