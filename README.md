_Franklin_ 
> Allow the lights to figure out what you're doing and automatically change settings accordingly.
For example: say you come home from work, and you walk into the house. 

_Leroy_ 
> Hook LIFX up to Wifi GPS. Then you don't need to control the lights and turn them on yourself.

_Mike_
> A great idea would be auto pairing with my smartphone and some settings to have lights automatically turn on and off based on proximity.

_Matthew_ 
> I'd really like to have the ability to use the smart bulbs as an alarm - to wake me in the morning. I'd want the option to use flashing colors or a gradually increasing white light. I think I saw that the alarm is planned and coming in an update - was wondering if that's the case, and maybe when we could use it! (I'm very excited)

_Everton_ 
> I would say auto wake up alarm light, anyway, The idea of LIFX bulb it is already a brilliant idea. Love it and I can't wait to get my hands on it.

_Gustavo_
> At a certain time (scheduled) the lights could dim-up so that you can start waiking up

_Aron_ 
> For your everyday sports fan, you could have the lights flash your teams colors for an assortment of things notifying you a game has started or finished, when your team has scored or the other

_David_ 
> I think it's a must that it has an emergency warning feature. In otherwords, they should be able to wake someone if the area they're in is about to experience an earthquake, tornado, or a tsunami. In these life and death situations, seconds count.

_Bart_
> Set them up at my work to show when tasks at my home computer are done (eg. downloads)
