_Franklin_ 
> Allow the lights to figure out what you're doing and automatically change settings accordingly.
For example: say you come home from work, and you walk into the house. 

_Leroy_ 
> Hook LIFX up to Wifi GPS. Then you don't need to control the lights and turn them on yourself.

_Mike_
> A great idea would be auto pairing with my smartphone and some settings to have lights automatically turn on and off based on proximity.

_Matthew_ 
> I'd really like to have the ability to use the smart bulbs as an alarm - to wake me in the morning. I'd want the option to use flashing colors or a gradually increasing white light. I think I saw that the alarm is planned and coming in an update - was wondering if that's the case, and maybe when we could use it! (I'm very excited)

_Everton_ 
> I would say auto wake up alarm light, anyway, The idea of LIFX bulb it is already a brilliant idea. Love it and I can't wait to get my hands on it.

_Gustavo_
> At a certain time (scheduled) the lights could dim-up so that you can start waiking up

_Aron_ 
> For your everyday sports fan, you could have the lights flash your teams colors for an assortment of things notifying you a game has started or finished, when your team has scored or the other

_David_ 
> I think it's a must that it has an emergency warning feature. In otherwords, they should be able to wake someone if the area they're in is about to experience an earthquake, tornado, or a tsunami. In these life and death situations, seconds count.

_Bart_
> Set them up at my work to show when tasks at my home computer are done (eg. downloads)

_Stanley_ 
> I would like a motion-sensor built in. I have backyard parties/bbqs/cookouts/etc. and once it's dark enough my solar lights kick in. I think it would be neat if the LIFX bulbs would turn on low when someone enters the sensor range, get brighter as the object gets closer, and then dimmer as it gets further away.

_Jacob_ 
> Set up a short range bluetooth signal that will sense a phone as you enter a room and turn on the lights automatically.

_Thomas_ 
> LIFX could be used for security reasons in combination with a motion sensor.

</tr>
</table>
 
_Ally_ 
> MY IDEA WOULD BE -Movie Mode (maybe somehow linked with Imdb or something) eg for a horror movie, you would search the movie name and it would still react to sound but maybe a light dimming pulse of lights when the movie is doing the creepy music, lights off for most the talking and flash with full bright when someone jumps out.

_Robert_ 
> Imagine immersing yourself further into a movie or a game with thunder and LIFX lightning or maybe an explosion triggering a bright yellow flash in the room. Would really add another dimension to home entertainment.

_Jim_ 
> Jim DM In movie theaters (IMAX style) to amplify 3D feelings of movies
